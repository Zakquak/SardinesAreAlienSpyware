	<h2>THEY AREN'T REAL</h2>
	<p>Have you ever seen a person eat a sardine? IT IS TOO LATE FOR THEM! Sardines are alien spyware deployed from a neighbouring planet to learn more about humans. every single sardine is fake, they are foreign metal casings containing high-tech invisible camera equipment and tracking devices, when people eat "sardines" they are actually eating aforementioned trackers that will now closely monitor your location on Earth, your behavior and pyschology. Under no circumstance should any person consume a sardine, as this will result in their death upon the alien invasion of the Earth.</p>
